# reactive-constructor [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/krstffr/reactive-constructor.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/krstffr/reactive-constructor)

This is a package for creating reactive-by-default objects. And what does that mean? Well, for example, let's say you have an ```Invoice``` object, which in turn has a couple of ```InvoiceListItem``` objects in it which has a ```name```, a ```price``` and a ```tax``` property. Let's say you want that Invoice object to automatically compute the sum of all the items ```price``` and ```tax``` values, and always has this value up to date no matter when an individual Item object is added, removed or changed. 

This would be super simple using reactive-constructor. Just do this:

```javascript

// Create the Invoice constructor
Invoice = ReactiveConstructor(function Invoice ( initData ) {
  
  // You need to set this.initData to the passed initData
  // (Maybe this will be updated in the future.)
  this.initData = initData;
  
  // Define the structure of this object.
  // You can have multiple types of invoices if you want,
  // but in this case we'll only have one.
  this.typeStructure = [{
    type: 'invoice',
    fields: {
      items: [InvoiceListItem],
    }
  }];
  
  // This method needs to be called like this.
  // (Maybe this will be updated in the future.)
  this.initReactiveValues();

});

// â€¦and setup the InvoiceListItem constructor
InvoiceListItem = ReactiveConstructor(function InvoiceListItem ( initData ) {

  this.initData = initData;
  
  this.typeStructure = [{
    type: 'invoiceListItem',
    fields: {
      itemName: String,
      price: Number,
      tax: Number
    }
  }];
  
  this.initReactiveValues();

});

// THIS IS HOW FAR I CAME BEFORE I HAD TO LEAVE
// TODO: Create two list items which will be part of the invoice
// TODO: Create the invoice
// TODO: Change reactive values

```
